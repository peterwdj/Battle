# Battle App
## Week 3 Challenge

#### Introduction

The challenge for this week was to create a simple battle game, deployed on the web via a local host. The week was designed as an introduction to the Sinatra web framework, GET and POST requests, the request/response cycle, servers, and front-end technologies such as HTML and CSS.


#### Instructions

To run the application, simply start a local server such as Rackup, and visit the correct localhost URL. From there, follow the on-screen instructions to play the battle game.


#### Challenges
The most challenging aspect of this week was the final exercise, using class methods and class variables in order to persist data throughout the application in place of the global variable that we had used (and been made to solemnly swear to never use ever in real life). Once discovering how to do this, I felt fairly comfortable with the concept, but making the leap to get there took a while. The other small hiccup I encountered was with requiring CSS files in an erb file in a Sinatra app, which occurs slightly differently to regular HTML files. However, once I had discovered how to do this, it was not a problem and, having previously done a bit of CSS and HTML, the new front-end technologies were not too problematic.
